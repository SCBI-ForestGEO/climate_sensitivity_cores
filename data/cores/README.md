# Data origin and processing

Raw data (.rwl files found in subfolders) are originally located in a [private GitHub repository](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data_private/tree/master/tree_cores/chronologies/current_chronologies/complete).

Raw data were copied over from the private GitHub repository to Dropbox folders, for co-author NP to standardized all ring-width series for each species via ARSTAN using a 2/3 n spline, where n is the number of years in each series (Cook, 1985; Cook & Kairiukstis, 1990). 
See methods of paper for more details.

Output of ARSTAN was then copied over from the Dropbox folders to here.
