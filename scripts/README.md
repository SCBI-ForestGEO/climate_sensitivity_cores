# scripts folder

This folder contains scripts for the analysis reported in this paper (add link to paper when published).

# to reproduce analysis

You can clone the [climate_sensitivity_cores](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/climate_sensitivity_cores) repository,
open [climate_sensitivity_cores.Rproj](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/climate_sensitivity_cores/blob/master/climate_sensitivity_cores.Rproj)
and run [0-RUN_ALL.R](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/climate_sensitivity_cores/blob/master/scripts/0-RUN_ALL.R)

Everything in the results folder will be created/updated. Results will be slightly different due to stochasticity related to bootstrapping.
