This folder contains climate data, copied from the ForestGEO Climate Data Portal. 

- [PRISM data](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/climate_sensitivity_cores/blob/master/raw_data/climate/PRISM_SCBI_1930_2015_30second.csv) comes from ForestGEO's private climate data repository. I copied the SCBI records (central cell) for all four variables into a singe spreadsheet. The [associated metadata](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/climate_sensitivity_cores/blob/master/raw_data/climate/Metadata_PRISM_ForestGEO%20Sites%20at%20US.pdf) pertains to the files from which this was taken, but should still make sense.
